# kpack

Experimental Build Service Kubernetes Resource Controllers.  

kpack extends [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) and utilizes kubernetes primitives to provide builds of OCI images as a platform implementation of [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io) (CNB).

kpack provides a declarative image type that builds an image and schedules image rebuilds on relevant buildpack and source changes.

kpack also provides a build type to execute a single Cloud Native Buildpack image build.


## Pre requirements

- Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` cli
- Docker V2 Registry

## Install

- Use the most recent [github release](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/releases).

### Creating an Image Resource

1. Create a builder resource. This resource tracks a builder on registry and will rebuild images when the builder has updated buildpacks. 
    Two types of builders can be created, Cluster Scoped Builders and Namespace Scoped Builders

    1. Namespace scoped builders
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: build.pivotal.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Builder
        metadata:
          name: sample-builder
        spec:
          image: cloudfoundry/cnb:bionic
          # imagePullSecrets: # Use these secrets if credentials are required to pull the builder
          # - name: builder-secret
        ```

   1. Cluster Scoped Builders
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: build.pivotal.io/v1alpha1
        kind: ClusterBuilder
        metadata:
          name: cluster-sample-builder
        spec:
          image: cloudfoundry/cnb:bionic
        ```
   **Note:** The Cluster Builder image must be publicly accessible.

1. Create a secret for push access to the desired docker registry.
   1. GCR example
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      metadata:
        name: basic-docker-user-pass
        annotations:
          build.pivotal.io/docker: gcr.io
      type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
      stringData:
        username: <username>
        password: <password>
      ```

    1. Docker Hub example
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
          name: basic-docker-user-pass
          annotations:
            build.pivotal.io/docker: index.docker.io
        type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
        stringData:
          username: <username>
          password: <password>
        ```
        
   **Note:** Because Docker Hub and GCR are hosted services, when referencing these registries in the `registry` field, use the domain names `index.docker.io` and `gcr.io` respectively.  For Artifactory or Harbor, reference the domain that is specific to your deployment of the registry.

1. Create a secret for pull access from the desired git repository. The example below is for a github repository.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: basic-git-user-pass
      annotations:
        build.pivotal.io/git: https://github.com
    type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
    stringData:
      username: <username>
      password: <password>
    ```

1. Create a service account that uses the docker registry secret and the git repository secret.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: service-account
    secrets:
      - name: basic-docker-user-pass
      - name: basic-git-user-pass
    ```

5. Apply an image configuration to the cluster.

    If you would like to build an image from a git repo:
 
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: build.pivotal.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Image
    metadata:
      name: sample-image
    spec:
      tag: gcr.io/project-name/app
      serviceAccount: service-account
      builder:
        name: sample-builder
        kind: Builder
      cacheSize: "1.5Gi" # Optional, if not set then the caching feature is disabled
      failedBuildHistoryLimit: 5 # Optional, if not present defaults to 10
      successBuildHistoryLimit: 5 # Optional, if not present defaults to 10
      source:
        git:
          url: https://github.com/buildpack/sample-java-app.git
          revision: master
      build: # Optional
        env:
          - name: BP_JAVA_VERSION
            value: 8.*
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 1G
          requests:
            cpu: 50m
            memory: 512M
    ```

    If you would like to build an image from a hosted zip or jar:
 
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: build.pivotal.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Image
    metadata:
      name: sample-image
    spec:
      tag: gcr.io/project-name/app
      serviceAccount: service-account
      builder:
        name: cluster-sample-builder
        kind: ClusterBuilder
      cacheSize: "1.5Gi" # Optional, if not set then the caching feature is disabled
      failedBuildHistoryLimit: 5 # Optional, if not present defaults to 10
      successBuildHistoryLimit: 5 # Optional, if not present defaults to 10
      source:
        blob:
          url: https://storage.googleapis.com/build-service/sample-apps/spring-petclinic-2.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
      build: # Optional
        env:
          - name: BP_JAVA_VERSION
            value: 8.*
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 1G
          requests:
            cpu: 50m
            memory: 512M
    ```

6.  See the builds for the image

    ```builds
    kubectl get builds # before the first builds completes you will see a unknown (building) status
    ---------------
    NAME                          SHA   SUCCEEDED
    sample-image-build-1-ea3e6fa9         Unknown  

    ```

After a build has completed you will be able to see the built digest

### Tailing Logs from Builds

Use the log tailing utility in `cmd/logs`

```bash
go build ./cmd/logs
```

The logs tool allows you to view the logs for all builds for an image: 

```bash
./logs -image <IMAGE-NAME>
```

To view logs from a specific build use the build flag:  

```bash
./logs -image <IMAGE-NAME> -build <BUILD-NUMBER>
```

## Local Development Install

Access to a Kubernetes cluster is needed in order to install the kpack controllers.

```bash
kubectl cluster-info # ensure you have access to a cluster
./hack/apply.sh <IMAGE/NAME> # <IMAGE/NAME> is a writable and publicly accessible location 
```

### Running Tests

* To run the e2e tests, kpack must be installed and running on a cluster
* The IMAGE_REGISTRY environment variable must point at a registry with local write access 

    ```bash
    IMAGE_REGISTRY=gcr.io/<some-project> go test ./...
    ```
